This article is an update to my original article on Celgene (CELG) published on June 22, 2017. Celgene reported its financial results yesterday October 26, 2017, and although the quarter was good, lowered guidance crushed the stock price. In my opinion, some of the sag in price was justified, but for the most part, an overreaction. Celgene is still a fast-growing company, and I believe that current valuation is in alignment with the company's true worth. Therefore, I believe the company continues to offer the long-term oriented growth investor with potentially attractive returns.

Nevertheless, although Celgene did lower future guidance out to 2020, it is still forecasting high future growth - just not quite as high as previously. Therefore, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated forecasting video on Celgene with the lowered guidance figures included. Hopefully, this will assist Celgene investors with formulating a clearer perspective on what the long-term impacts of this lowered guidance might really mean. I believe you will find that the fear appears greater than the reality.
