Dear Reader,



In recent weeks, you may have seen these stories spreading on the internet, or even heard about friends and neighbors getting premium tv channels,
pay per view, movies that are even still in theaters, every episode of their favorite tv shows, every sports game in the country, and much
more...ALL FOR FREE



 



It is all thanks to a series of controversial laws that allow ordinary Americans just like you to access endless streams of content without having
to pay the giant media monopolies your hard earned money to do so.     You might agree with these laws, or you might
find them despicable. But one thing is undeniable, people all over the country are taking advantage... AND LOVING EVERY SECOND OF IT.
