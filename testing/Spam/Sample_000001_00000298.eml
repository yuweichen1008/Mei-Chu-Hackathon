Dear Beneficiary,</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Series of meetings have been held over the past 7 months with the secretary general of the United Nations Organization. This ended 3 days ago. It is obvious that you have not received your fund which is to the tune of One Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($1,500,000.00) due to past corrupt Governmental Officials who almost held the fund to themselves for their selfish reasons and some individuals who have taken advantage of your fund all in an attempt to swindle your fund which has led to so many losses from your end and unnecessary delay in the receipt of your fund.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
The National Central Bureau of Interpol enhanced by the United Nations and Federal Bureau of Investigation have successfully passed a mandate to the president of United States Of America, His Excellency President Donald Trump to boost the exercise of clearing all foreign debts owed to you and other individuals and organizations who have been found not to have receive their Contract Sum, Lottery/Gambling. </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Now how would you like to receive your payment? Because we have two method of payment which is by Check or by ATM card?</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
ATM Card: We will be issuing you a custom pin based ATM card which you will use to withdraw up to $3,000 per day from any ATM machine that has the MasterCard Logo on it and the card have to be renewed in 4 years time which is 2019. Also with the ATM card you will be able to transfer your funds to your local bank account. The ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten you about how to use it. Even if you do not have a bank account.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Check: To be deposited in your bank for it to be cleared within three working days. Your payment would be sent to you via any of your preferred option and would be mailed to you via DHL. Because we have signed a contract with DHL which should expire in next three weeks you will only need to pay $310 instead of $600 saving you $290. So if you pay before the three weeks you save $290. Take note that anyone asking you for some kind of money above the usual fee is definitely a fraudster and you will have to stop communication with every other person if you have been in contact with any.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Also remember that all you will ever have to spend is $310.00 nothing more! Nothing less! And we guarantee the receipt of your fund to be successfully delivered to you within the next 48hrs after the receipt of payment has been confirmed.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Note: Everything has been taken care of by the Federal Government, the United Nations and also the FBI including taxes, custom paper and clearance duty so all you will ever need to pay is $310.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANYONE UNTIL YOU READ THIS: The actual fees for shipping your ATM card is $600 but because DHL have temporarily discontinued the C.O.D which gives you the chance to pay when package is delivered for international shipping, We had to sign contract with them for bulk shipping which makes the fees reduce from the actual fee of $600 to $310 nothing more and no hidden fees of any sort!</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
