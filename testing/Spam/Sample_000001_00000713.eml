Attention: Beneficiary,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
In compliance with the mandate to investigate administrative irregularities in bureaucratic institutions, the ten-man presidential task-force on payment reconciliation is obliged to notify you of the ongoing review of your pending $20Million payment. After due consultations with the institutions responsible for the stall of your overdue payment, we wish to inform you that your Inheritance claim has reached its final verification phase, and an irrevocable payment approval will be granted afterwards.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Note that the ten-man task-force is adequately resourced having the capacity to effectively pursue its given mandate without seeking your financial input in regard to this matter. In view of this, you will NOT be required to pay an upfront fee before your funds can be transferred. By the virtue of our reconciliation-intervention might, the approval of divers outstanding payments were reconciled by the ten-man presidential task-force with over $20 billion released to recipients from virtually every continent in the world.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
As an ad hoc constituted watchdog, the ten-man task-force is tasked with the responsibility of reviewing overdue payments such as your funds and funds suspended by any Ministry, Department and Agency of government. Since the inauguration of the task-force in 2015, the task-force has relentlessly been looking into the activities involving stakeholders and public private organizations to ensure total adherence to government policies, (depending on the nature of shenanigans observed) to draw the attention of the presidency for the necessary actions to be taken.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Some other objectives of the task-force are, reconciliation of debts directly owed to government contractors both local &amp; foreign, Review of inheritance refusals and filtration of Ghost claims i.e.(none appearance claims), providing best-practice recommendations to the presidency for effective policy making, recalling unspent allocations from MDAs (Agency, Ministry and Department), and if need be, to subjecting the procurement made by MDAs and mode of fund disbursements for a congressional review.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
By this notice, you are required to treat this notice with utmost urgency to enable us further complete all arrangements in securing your Letter of Administration from the probate registry. If your information has changed over the years, you are advised to reconfirm your updated information so that no error will be found by the time the payment schedule is published.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Thanks for your time, we hope to read from you at your earliest convenience.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Warmest Regards,</DIV>
<DIV>
Alloy Adigun Tanko.</DIV>
<DIV>
Publicity Secretary, Ten-man Presidential Task-force On Payment Reconciliation.</DIV>
